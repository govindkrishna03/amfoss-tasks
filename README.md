Who am I?


 Hey seniors...
    My name is  Govind Krishna and I am a student of S1 CSE-D batch.Basically I am from Kollam, a district in Kerala.Joined Amrita for my under-graduate degree.I was eager to learn about computers and networking etc.I have heard of AMFOSS and BIOS before i joined Amrita through social medias and also from my brother.Even he graduated from amrita the same year and was also active member of Amfoss club..Though i am new to this fielding i felt it would be hard for me to do coding and all and do those stuffs, but doing these tasks made me more  confident.
