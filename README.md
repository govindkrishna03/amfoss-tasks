Who am I?


        Hey seniors...
              I am Govind Krishna of S1 CSE.My hometown is Kollam,Kerala.Completed my 12th with bio stream and joined Amrita for B.Tech.Since childhood i love computers.
I was eager to learn about computers and networking etc.I have heard of AMFOSS and BIOS before i joined Amrita through social medias and even from my brother.Even he is a mentor in the club..Though i am new to this fielding i felt it would be hard for me to do coding and all and do those stuffs, but doing these tasks made me more confident.
