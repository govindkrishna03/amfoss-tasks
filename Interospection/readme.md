  Hey guys,My name is Govind Krishna.
Why must we choose you?

                  So basically i am from a bio- backgrounnd.But still i love computers,the way they works and i love to learn those stuffs.Still i am a kiddo learning little by little but i am sure i would not step back telling that i cant do this.I want to be more active during my college life and to be productive somehow.So this is what i have to say🙂.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

	If i get a chance to be in the club , the first thing i wanna do is to manage my time and carry on with my studies and the club. I rather like to be with the club most time...😁.Apart from that i can increase my skills and learn many new things from my senior chetans and chechis😁..

How would you contribute back to the club?

	I like working so much but i have never got a chance to do so.If i get I am sure i will work till you guys need me.So I would do the maximum that i can and contribute to the club............
	
Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

	Regarding the selection process..
	 	So basically everybody is from different background right like some are from Computer Science and some are from Bio. Though the cs students have an upper hand even bio student can do these stuffs.Even students can copy right. There are some students who couldnt finish the tasks , did not  copy from others but they will learn much faster than otherss and even they would be great assets to the club if identified. Should find people like those too...(that is like me ah.hehe😁).
